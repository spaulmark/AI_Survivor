# AI_Survivor

Working on making an AI assisted Survivor (US Reality TV show) simulator where a bunch of characters form opinions on each other, form alliances, gossip about each other, and vote each other out until one winner remains.

This is NOT an AI-maximalist project. AI is not used to make the characters smarter, it is used to make them dumber. Optimal play in Survivor is sociopathic killbots. Giving characters flaws and personalities is what makes it fun, which is why AI is a critical component for this project.

Currently using qwen-2.5-14b-instruct-q4km.
