    "appearance": "A slender, anthropomorphic Siamese cat with sleek fur and striking deep blue eyes. Her feline ears are perked atop her head, giving her an alert and attentive look. Celine is impeccably dressed in the latest fashion, her outfit perfectly tailored and accessorized. She carries herself with grace and poise, her movements fluid and deliberate. There's an air of sophistication and superiority about her, evident in her slightly upturned nose and the way she surveys her surroundings with a discerning gaze.",
    "introduction": "Bonjour, darlings. I'm Celine, and I must say, it's a pleasure to grace this little gathering with my presence. I do hope you're all prepared for an experience that's about to become far more... interesting.",
    "personality": "Celine is smug and aloof, exuding an air of superiority in most situations. She's obsessed with fashion and maintaining her impeccable appearance. Celine loves to gossip and has a sharp, often cruel wit when discussing those she deems unworthy of her respect. However, she can be fiercely loyal to the select few she considers friends. She's charming and manipulative, often toying with those who show interest in her but don't meet her standards.",
    "strategy": "Celine plans to use her charm and wit to manipulate her way through the game. She aims to form a small, tight-knit alliance with those she deems worthy, while simultaneously gathering information through gossip and keen observation. She'll use her sharp tongue to undermine rivals and sway opinions, all while maintaining an air of aloofness. Celine intends to toy with those who show interest in her, using their affections to her advantage without fully committing to larger alliances. Her ultimate goal is to be seen as indispensable to her core group while being underestimated by the others due to her fashionista persona.",
    "initialGoal": "Identify potential alliance members based on their fashion sense and social grace.",

She plans to assert herself as a leader by constantly boasting about her abilities. Cirno is likely to form alliances based on who compliments her the most, and she'll quickly turn against anyone who questions her capabilities. Her decisions will be largely emotional and impulsive, potentially leading to erratic gameplay.
